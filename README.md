# RSA Program
Program Java console based to implement an encryption and decryption using RSA algorithm.

## RSA Encryption Overview
RSA algorithms are the most popular, because they are considered "safe":
* Do the factoring of very large numbers.
* To generate 2 keys, two large random primes are selected
